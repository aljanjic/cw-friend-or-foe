# Notes

Make a program that filters a list of strings and returns a list with only your friends name in it.

If a name has exactly 4 letters in it, you can be sure that it has to be a friend of yours! Otherwise, you can be sure he's not...

Ex: Input = ["Ryan", "Kieran", "Jason", "Yous"], Output = ["Ryan", "Yous"]

i.e.

friend ["Ryan", "Kieran", "Mark"] `shouldBe` ["Ryan", "Mark"]

Note: keep the original order of the names in the output.

'["Ryan", "Kieran", "Mark"] should return ["Ryan", "Mark"]'
'["Ryan", "Jimmy", "123", "4", "Cool Man"] should return ["Ryan"]'
'["Jimm", "Cari", "aret", "truehdnviegkwgvke", "sixtyiscooooool"] should return ["Jimm", "Cari", "aret"]'

'["Love", "Your", "Face", "1"] should return ["Love", "Your", "Face"]'
